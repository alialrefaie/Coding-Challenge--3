# Coding Challenge #3
 # Car Class Implementation

This project involves implementing a `Car` class in JavaScript to manage the car's speed with functionality to accelerate and brake.

## Tasks
- Implement a `Car` class with a constructor that initializes `make` and `speed` properties.
- Add an `accelerate` method to increase the car's speed by 10 km/h.
- Add a `brake` method to decrease the car's speed by 5 km/h.
- Create and test `Car` objects with the provided test data.

## Test Data
- Car 1: A 'BMW' starting at 120 km/h.
- Car 2: A 'Mercedes' starting at 95 km/h.
